# Battleship

This project was completed as a way to experiment with
Test Driven Development (TDD) and gain more experience with OOP. I used the Jest Testing Framework for this project.
Using Jest I was able to implement almost all of the game logic
before building anything in the DOM.

The game works by setting up a GameLoop object and creating two players.
Each player is then assigned a board object, which in turn is assigned five ship objects.
The game then steps between turns until a player wins the game.
